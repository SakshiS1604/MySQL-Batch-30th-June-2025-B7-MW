 -- Select, Alter, delete & update Queries
 
 /*
 1. SELECT Query
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. 
It allows you to specify the columns you want to fetch and apply conditions to filter the results.

Syntax-

SELECT column1, column2, ...  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;  

2. ALTER Query
The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing table, 
such as adding, deleting, or modifying columns.
The ALTER query changes the table structure, not the data.

Syntax-

ALTER TABLE table_name  
ADD column_name datatype;  
-- or  
ALTER TABLE table_name  
DROP COLUMN column_name;  
-- or  
ALTER TABLE table_name  
MODIFY column_name new_datatype;  

3. DELETE Query
The DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a table based on a specified condition.

Syntax- 

DELETE FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;  

4. UPDATE Query
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

Syntax:

UPDATE table_name  
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...  
WHERE condition;

/*
Using Information Schema Views:

Most relational database management systems (RDBMS) provide system views that contain 
metadata about the database objects, including constraints. You can query these views 
to find constraint names.
*/

-- to get complete information about constraints and its name.

SELECT CONSTRAINT_NAME, TABLE_NAME, CONSTRAINT_TYPE
FROM information_schema.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'Flights';

/*
Naming Conventions:

If you are creating constraints, it's a good practice to use a consistent naming convention. 
This can help you easily identify constraints later. A common convention is to use the format:

For CHECK constraints: chk_<table>_<column>
For UNIQUE constraints: unique_<table>_<column>
For FOREIGN KEY constraints: fk_<table>_<referenced_table>

Example of Adding Constraints with Naming Conventions

ALTER TABLE Flights 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_flight_duration CHECK (Flight_Duration > 0);
